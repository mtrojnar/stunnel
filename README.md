# stunnel overview


### Short description

The stunnel program is designed to work as an SSL encryption
wrapper between remote client and local (inetd-startable) or
remote servers. The goal is to facilitate SSL encryption and
authentication for non-SSL-aware programs.

stunnel can be used to add  SSL  functionality  to  commonly
used  inetd  daemons  like  POP-2,  POP-3  and  IMAP servers
without any changes in the programs' code.
