=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<stunnel> program is designed to work as I<TLS> encryption wrapper
between remote clients and local (I<inetd>-startable) or remote
servers. The concept is that having non-TLS aware daemons running on
your system you can easily set them up to communicate with clients over
secure I<TLS> channels.

B<stunnel> can be used to add I<TLS> functionality to commonly used I<Inetd>
daemons like POP-2, POP-3, and IMAP servers, to standalone daemons like
NNTP, SMTP and HTTP, and in tunneling PPP over network sockets without
changes to the source code.

This product includes cryptographic software written by
Eric Young (eay@cryptsoft.com)

=head2 GLOBAL OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<chroot> = DIRECTORY (Unix only)

directory to chroot B<stunnel> process

B<chroot> keeps B<stunnel> in a chrooted jail.  I<CApath>, I<CRLpath>, I<pid>
and I<exec> are located inside the jail and the patches have to be relative
to the directory specified with B<chroot>.

Several functions of the operating system also need their files to be located within the chroot jail, e.g.:

=over 4

=item *

Delayed resolver typically needs /etc/nsswitch.conf and /etc/resolv.conf.

=item *

Local time in log files needs /etc/timezone.

=item *

Some other functions may need devices, e.g. /dev/zero or /dev/null.

you distinguish B<stunnel> services in your log files.

Note that if you wish to run B<stunnel> in I<inetd> mode (where it
is provided a network socket by a server such as I<inetd>, I<xinetd>,
or I<tcpserver>) then you should read the section entitled I<INETD MODE>
below.


=over 4

=item B<accept> = [HOST:]PORT

accept connections on specified address

If no host specified, defaults to all IPv4 addresses for the local host.

To listen on all IPv6 addresses use:

    accept = :::PORT

=item B<CApath> = DIRECTORY

Certificate Authority directory

This is the directory in which B<stunnel> will look for certificates when using
the I<verifyChain> or I<verifyPeer> options.  Note that the certificates in
this directory should be named XXXXXXXX.0 where XXXXXXXX is the hash value of
the DER encoded subject of the cert.

The hash algorithm has been changed in B<OpenSSL 1.0.0>.  It is required to
c_rehash the directory on upgrade from B<OpenSSL 0.x.x> to B<OpenSSL 1.x.x>.

I<CApath> path is relative to the I<chroot> directory if specified.

=item B<CAfile> = CA_FILE

to authenticate itself against the remote client or server.
The file should contain the whole certificate chain starting from the actual
server/client certificate, and ending with the self-signed root CA certificate.
The file must be either in PEM or P12 format.

A certificate chain is required in server mode, and optional in client mode.

This parameter is also used as the certificate identifier when a hardware
engine is enabled.

=item B<checkEmail> = EMAIL

email address of the peer certificate subject

Multiple I<checkEmail> options are allowed in a single service section.
Certificates are accepted if no subject checks were specified, or the email
address of the peer certificate matches any of the email addresses specified
with I<checkEmail>.

This option requires OpenSSL 1.0.2 or later.

client mode (remote service uses TLS)

default: no (server mode)

=item B<config> = COMMAND[:PARAMETER]

B<OpenSSL> configuration command

The B<OpenSSL> configuration command is executed with the specified parameter.
This allows any configuration commands to be invoked from the stunnel
configuration file.  Supported commands are described on the
I<SSL_CONF_cmd(3ssl)> manual page.

Several I<config> lines can be used to specify multiple configuration commands.

Use I<curves> option instead of enabling I<config = Curves:list_curves> to support elliptic curves.

This option requires OpenSSL 1.0.2 or later.

=item B<connect> = [HOST:]PORT

connect to a remote address

If no host is specified, the host defaults to localhost.

Multiple I<connect> options are allowed in a single service section.

If host resolves to multiple addresses and/or if multiple I<connect>
options are specified, then the remote address is chosen using a
round-robin algorithm.

=item B<CRLpath> = DIRECTORY

Certificate Revocation Lists directory

This is the directory in which B<stunnel> will look for CRLs when using the
I<verifyChain> and I<verifyPeer> options. Note that the CRLs in this directory
should be named XXXXXXXX.r0 where XXXXXXXX is the hash value of the CRL.

The hash algorithm has been changed in B<OpenSSL 1.0.0>.  It is required to
c_rehash the directory on upgrade from B<OpenSSL 0.x.x> to B<OpenSSL 1.x.x>.

I<CRLpath> path is relative to the I<chroot> directory if specified.

    prime256v1 (OpenSSL older than 1.1.1)

=item B<logId> = TYPE

connection identifier type

This identifier allows you to distinguish log entries generated for each of the
connections.

Currently supported types:

=over 4

=item I<sequential>

The numeric sequential identifier is only unique within a single instance of
B<stunnel>, but very compact.  It is most useful for manual log analysis.

=item I<unique>

This alphanumeric identifier is globally unique, but longer than the sequential
number.  It is most useful for automated log analysis.

=item I<thread>

The operating system thread identifier is neither unique (even within a single
instance of B<stunnel>) nor short.  It is most useful for debugging software
or configuration issues.

=item I<process>

The operating system process identifier (PID) may be useful in the inetd mode.

=back

default: sequential

=item B<debug> = LEVEL

debugging level

Level is a one of the syslog level names or numbers
emerg (0), alert (1), crit (2), err (3), warning (4), notice (5),
info (6), or debug (7).  All logs for the specified level and
all levels numerically less than it will be shown.
The default is notice (5).

While the I<debug = debug> or I<debug = 7> level generates the most verbose
output, it is only intended to be used by stunnel developers.  Please only use
this value if you are a developer, or you intend to send your logs to our
technical support.  Otherwise, the generated logs B<will> be confusing.

=item B<delay> = yes | no

delay DNS lookup for the I<connect> option

This option is useful for dynamic DNS, or when DNS is not available during
B<stunnel> startup (road warrior VPN, dial-up configurations).

Delayed resolver mode is automatically engaged when stunnel fails to resolve on
startup any of the I<connect> targets for a service.

Delayed resolver inflicts I<failover = prio>.

default: no

=item B<engineId> = ENGINE_ID

select engine ID for the service

=item B<engineNum> = ENGINE_NUMBER

select engine number for the service

The engines are numbered starting from 1.

=item B<exec> = EXECUTABLE_PATH

I<exec> path is relative to the I<chroot> directory if specified.

The following environmental variables are set on Unix platforms:
REMOTE_HOST, REMOTE_PORT, SSL_CLIENT_DN, SSL_CLIENT_I_DN.

=item B<execArgs> = $0 $1 $2 ...

arguments for I<exec> including the program name ($0)

Quoting is currently not supported.
Arguments are separated with an arbitrary amount of whitespace.

=item B<failover> = rr | prio

Failover strategy for multiple "connect" targets.

=over 4

=item I<rr>

round robin - fair load distribution

=item I<prio>

=back

default: prio

=item B<ident> = USERNAME

use IDENT (RFC 1413) username checking

=item B<include> = DIRECTORY

include all configuration file parts located in DIRECTORY

The files are included in the ascending alphabetical order of their names. The recommended filename convention is

for global options:

	00-global.conf

for local service-level options:

	01-service.conf

	02-service.conf

=item B<key> = KEY_FILE

private key for the certificate specified with I<cert> option

A private key is needed to authenticate the certificate owner.
Since this file should be kept secret it should only be readable
by its owner.  On Unix systems you can use the following command:

    chmod 600 keyfile

This parameter is also used as the private key identifier when a hardware
engine is enabled.

default: the value of the I<cert> option

=item B<libwrap> = yes | no

Enable or disable the use of /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny.

default: no (since version 5.00)

=item B<local> = HOST

By default, the IP address of the outgoing interface is used as the source for
remote connections.  Use this option to bind a static local IP address instead.

=item B<OCSP> = URL

select OCSP responder for certificate verification

=item B<OCSPaia> = yes | no

validate certificates with their AIA OCSP responders

This option enables I<stunnel> to validate certificates with the list of
OCSP responder URLs retrieved from their AIA (Authority Information Access)
extension.

=item B<OCSPflag> = OCSP_FLAG

specify OCSP responder flag

Several I<OCSPflag> can be used to specify multiple flags.

currently supported flags: NOCERTS, NOINTERN, NOSIGS, NOCHAIN, NOVERIFY,
NOEXPLICIT, NOCASIGN, NODELEGATED, NOCHECKS, TRUSTOTHER, RESPID_KEY, NOTIME

=item B<OCSPnonce> = yes | no

send and verify the OCSP nonce extension

This option protects the OCSP protocol against replay attacks.  Due to its
computational overhead, the nonce extension is usually only supported on
internal (e.g. corporate) responders, and not on public OCSP responders.

=item B<options> = SSL_OPTIONS

B<OpenSSL> library options

The parameter is the B<OpenSSL> option name as described in the
I<SSL_CTX_set_options(3ssl)> manual, but without I<SSL_OP_> prefix.
I<stunnel -options> lists the options found to be allowed in the
current combination of I<stunnel> and the I<OpenSSL> library used
to build it.

Several I<option> lines can be used to specify multiple options.
An option name can be prepended with a dash ("-") to disable the option.

For example, for compatibility with the erroneous Eudora TLS
implementation, the following option can be used:

    options = DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS

default:

    options = NO_SSLv2
    options = NO_SSLv3

Use I<sslVersionMax> or I<sslVersionMin> option instead of disabling specific TLS protocol
versions when compiled with B<OpenSSL 1.1.0> or later.

=item B<protocol> = PROTO

application protocol to negotiate TLS

This option enables initial, protocol-specific negotiation of the TLS
encryption.
The I<protocol> option should not be used with TLS encryption on a separate port.

=item B<protocolHost> = ADDRESS

host address for the protocol negotiations

For the 'connect' protocol negotiations, I<protocolHost> specifies HOST:PORT of
the final TLS server to be connected to by the proxy.  The proxy server
directly connected by B<stunnel> must be specified with the I<connect> option.

For the 'smtp' protocol negotiations, I<protocolHost> controls the client SMTP
HELO/EHLO value.

used for authentication.  This option is ignored in server sections.

default: the first identity specified in the I<PSKsecrets> file.

=item B<PSKsecrets> = FILE

file with PSK identities and corresponding keys

Each line of the file in the following format:

    IDENTITY:KEY

Hexadecimal keys are automatically converted to binary form.

Applications of the TLS renegotiation include some authentication scenarios,
or re-keying long lasting connections.

On the other hand this feature can facilitate a trivial CPU-exhaustion
DoS attack:

Please note that disabling TLS renegotiation does not fully mitigate
this issue.

default: yes (if supported by B<OpenSSL>)

=item B<reset> = yes | no

attempt to use the TCP RST flag to indicate an error

This option is not supported on some platforms.

default: yes

=item B<retry> = yes | no

default: no

=item B<securityLevel> = LEVEL

set the security level

The meaning of each level is described below:

=over 4

=item level 0

Everything is permitted.

=item level 1

The security level corresponds to a minimum of 80 bits of security. Any parameters offering below 80 bits of security are excluded. As a result RSA, DSA and DH keys shorter than 1024 bits and ECC keys shorter than 160 bits are prohibited. All export cipher suites are prohibited since they all offer less than 80 bits of security. SSL version 2 is prohibited. Any cipher suite using MD5 for the MAC is also prohibited.

=item level 2

Security level set to 112 bits of security. As a result RSA, DSA and DH keys shorter than 2048 bits and ECC keys shorter than 224 bits are prohibited. In addition to the level 1 exclusions any cipher suite using RC4 is also prohibited. SSL version 3 is also not allowed. Compression is disabled.

=item level 3

Security level set to 128 bits of security. As a result RSA, DSA and DH keys shorter than 3072 bits and ECC keys shorter than 256 bits are prohibited. In addition to the level 2 exclusions cipher suites not offering forward secrecy are prohibited. TLS versions below 1.1 are not permitted. Session tickets are disabled.

=item level 4

Security level set to 192 bits of security. As a result RSA, DSA and DH keys shorter than 7680 bits and ECC keys shorter than 384 bits are prohibited. Cipher suites using SHA1 for the MAC are prohibited. TLS versions below 1.2 are not permitted.

=item level 5

Security level set to 256 bits of security. As a result RSA, DSA and DH keys shorter than 15360 bits and ECC keys shorter than 512 bits are prohibited.

=item default: 2

=back

The I<securityLevel> option is only available when compiled with B<OpenSSL 1.1.0> and later.

=item B<requireCert> = yes | no

require a client certificate for I<verifyChain> or I<verifyPeer>

With I<requireCert> set to I<no>, the B<stunnel> server accepts client
connections that did not present a certificate.

Both I<verifyChain = yes> and I<verifyPeer = yes> imply I<requireCert = yes>.

default: no

=item B<setgid> = GROUP (Unix only)

Unix group id

As a global option: setgid() to the specified group in daemon mode and clear all other groups.

As a service-level option: set the group of the Unix socket specified with "accept".

=item B<setuid> = USER (Unix only)

Unix user id

As a global option: setuid() to the specified user in daemon mode.

As a service-level option: set the owner of the Unix socket specified with "accept".

=item B<sessionCacheSize> = NUM_ENTRIES

session cache size

I<sessionCacheSize> specifies the maximum number of the internal session cache
entries.

The value of 0 can be used for unlimited size.  It is not recommended
for production use due to the risk of a memory exhaustion DoS attack.

=item B<sessionCacheTimeout> = TIMEOUT

session cache timeout

This is the number of seconds to keep cached TLS sessions.

=item B<sessiond> = HOST:PORT

address of sessiond TLS cache server

=item B<sni> = SERVICE_NAME:SERVER_NAME_PATTERN (server mode)

Use the service as a slave service (a name-based virtual server) for Server
Name Indication TLS extension (RFC 3546).

I<SERVICE_NAME> specifies the master service that accepts client connections
with the I<accept> option.  I<SERVER_NAME_PATTERN> specifies the host name to
be redirected.  The pattern may start with the '*' character, e.g.
'*.example.com'.  Multiple slave services are normally specified for a single
master service.  The I<sni> option can also be specified more than once within
a single slave service.

This service, as well as the master service, may not be configured in client
mode.

The I<connect> option of the slave service is ignored when the I<protocol>
option is specified, as I<protocol> connects to the remote host before TLS
handshake.

Libwrap checks (Unix only) are performed twice: with the master service name
after TCP connection is accepted, and with the slave service name during the
TLS handshake.

The I<sni> option is only available when compiled with B<OpenSSL 1.0.0> and
later.

=item B<sni> = SERVER_NAME (client mode)

Use the parameter as the value of TLS Server Name Indication (RFC 3546)
extension.

Empty SERVER_NAME disables sending the SNI extension.

The I<sni> option is only available when compiled with B<OpenSSL 1.0.0> and
later.

=item B<socket> = a|l|r:OPTION=VALUE[:VALUE]

Set an option on the accept/local/remote socket

The values for the linger option are l_onof:l_linger.
The values for the time are tv_sec:tv_usec.

Examples:

    socket = l:SO_LINGER=1:60
        set one minute timeout for closing local socket
    socket = r:SO_OOBINLINE=yes
        place out-of-band data directly into the
        receive data stream for remote sockets
    socket = a:SO_REUSEADDR=no
        disable address reuse (enabled by default)
    socket = a:SO_BINDTODEVICE=lo
        only accept connections on loopback interface

=item B<sslVersion> = SSL_VERSION

select the TLS protocol version

Supported versions: all, SSLv2, SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2, TLSv1.3

Availability of specific protocols depends on the linked OpenSSL library.
Older versions of OpenSSL do not support TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3.
Newer versions of OpenSSL do not support SSLv2.

Obsolete SSLv2 and SSLv3 are currently disabled by default.

Setting the option

    sslVersion = SSL_VERSION

is equivalent to options

    sslVersionMax = SSL_VERSION
    sslVersionMin = SSL_VERSION

when compiled with B<OpenSSL 1.1.0> and later.

=item B<sslVersionMax> = SSL_VERSION

maximum supported protocol versions

Supported versions: all, SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2, TLSv1.3

I<all> enable protocol versions up to the highest version supported by the
linked OpenSSL library.

Availability of specific protocols depends on the linked OpenSSL library.

The I<sslVersionMax> option is only available when compiled with B<OpenSSL 1.1.0> and later.

default: all

=item B<sslVersionMin> = SSL_VERSION

minimum supported protocol versions

Supported versions: all, SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2, TLSv1.3

I<all> enable protocol versions down to the lowest version supported by the
linked OpenSSL library.

Availability of specific protocols depends on the linked OpenSSL library.

The I<sslVersionMin> option is only available when compiled with B<OpenSSL 1.1.0> and later.

default: TLSv1

=item B<stack> = BYTES (except for FORK model)

CPU stack size of created threads

Excessive thread stack size increases virtual memory usage.
Insufficient thread stack size may cause application crashes.

default: 65536 bytes (sufficient for all platforms we tested)

=item B<ticketKeySecret> = SECRET

hexadecimal symmetric key used for session ticket confidentiality protection

Session tickets defined in RFC 5077 provide an enhanced session resumption
capability, where the server-side caching is not required to maintain per
session state.

Combining I<ticketKeySecret> and I<ticketMacSecret> options allow to resume a
negotiated session on other cluster nodes, or to resume a negotiated
session after server restart.

The key is required to be either 16 or 32 bytes long, which implies exactly 32
or 64 hexadecimal digits.  Colons may optionally be used between two-character
hexadecimal bytes.

This option only works in server mode.

The I<ticketKeySecret> option is only available when compiled with
B<OpenSSL 1.0.0> and later.

Disabling I<NO_TICKET> option is required for the ticket support in OpenSSL
older than 1.1.1, but note that this option is incompatible with the
I<redirect> option.

=item B<ticketMacSecret> = SECRET

hexadecimal symmetric key used for session ticket integrity protection

The key is required to be either 16 or 32 bytes long, which implies exactly 32
or 64 hexadecimal digits.  Colons may optionally be used between two-character
hexadecimal bytes.

This option only works in server mode.

The I<ticketMacSecret> option is only available when compiled with
B<OpenSSL 1.0.0> and later.

=item B<TIMEOUTbusy> = SECONDS

time to wait for expected data

=item B<TIMEOUTclose> = SECONDS

time to wait for close_notify (set to 0 for buggy MSIE)

=item B<TIMEOUTconnect> = SECONDS

time to wait to connect to a remote host

=item B<TIMEOUTidle> = SECONDS

time to keep an idle connection

=item B<transparent> = none | source | destination | both (Unix only)

enable transparent proxy support on selected platforms

Supported values:

=over 4

=item I<none>

Disable transparent proxy support.  This is the default.

=item I<source>

Re-write the address to appear as if a wrapped daemon is connecting
from the TLS client machine instead of the machine running B<stunnel>.

This option is currently available in:

=over 4

=item Remote mode (I<connect> option) on I<Linux E<gt>=2.6.28>

This configuration requires B<stunnel> to be executed as root and without
the I<setuid> option.

This configuration requires the following setup for iptables and routing
(possibly in /etc/rc.local or equivalent file):

    iptables -t mangle -N DIVERT
    iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp -m socket -j DIVERT
    iptables -t mangle -A DIVERT -j MARK --set-mark 1
    iptables -t mangle -A DIVERT -j ACCEPT
    ip rule add fwmark 1 lookup 100
    ip route add local 0.0.0.0/0 dev lo table 100
    echo 0 >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/lo/rp_filter

B<stunnel> must also to be executed as root and without the I<setuid> option.

=item Remote mode (I<connect> option) on I<Linux 2.2.x>

This configuration requires the kernel to be compiled with the I<transparent proxy>
option.
Connected service must be installed on a separate host.
Routing towards the clients has to go through the B<stunnel> box.

B<stunnel> must also to be executed as root and without the I<setuid> option.

=item Remote mode (I<connect> option) on I<FreeBSD E<gt>=8.0>

This configuration requires additional firewall and routing setup.
B<stunnel> must also to be executed as root and without the I<setuid> option.

=item Local mode (I<exec> option)

This configuration works by pre-loading the I<libstunnel.so> shared library.
_RLD_LIST environment variable is used on Tru64, and LD_PRELOAD variable on
other platforms.

=back

=item I<destination>

The original destination is used instead of the I<connect> option.

A service section for transparent destination may look like this:

    [transparent]
    client = yes
    accept = <stunnel_port>
    transparent = destination

This configuration requires iptables setup to work,
possibly in /etc/rc.local or equivalent file.

For a connect target installed on the same host:

    /sbin/iptables -t nat -I OUTPUT -p tcp --dport <redirected_port> \
        -m ! --uid-owner <stunnel_user_id> \
        -j DNAT --to-destination <local_ip>:<stunnel_port>

For a connect target installed on a remote host:

    /sbin/iptables -I INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport <stunnel_port> -j ACCEPT
    /sbin/iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -p tcp --dport <redirected_port> \
        -i eth0 -j DNAT --to-destination <local_ip>:<stunnel_port>

The transparent destination option is currently only supported on Linux.

=item I<both>

Use both I<source> and I<destination> transparent proxy.

=back

Two legacy options are also supported for backward compatibility:

=over 4

=item I<yes>

This option has been renamed to I<source>.

=item I<no>

This option has been renamed to I<none>.

=back

=item B<verify> = LEVEL

verify the peer certificate

This option is obsolete and should be replaced with the I<verifyChain>
and I<verifyPeer> options.

=over 4

=item level 0

Request and ignore the peer certificate.

=item level 1

Verify the peer certificate if present.

=item level 2

Verify the peer certificate.

=item level 3

Verify the peer against a locally installed certificate.

=item level 4

Ignore the chain and only verify the peer certificate.

=item default

No verify.

=back

=item B<verifyChain> = yes | no

verify the peer certificate chain starting from the root CA

For server certificate verification it is essential to also require a specific
certificate with I<checkHost> or I<checkIP>.

The self-signed root CA certificate needs to be stored either in the file
specified with I<CAfile>, or in the directory specified with I<CApath>.

default: no

=item B<verifyPeer> = yes | no

verify the peer certificate

The peer certificate needs to be stored either in the file
specified with I<CAfile>, or in the directory specified with I<CApath>.

default: no

=back


=head1 RETURN VALUE

B<stunnel> returns zero on success, non-zero on error.


=head1 SIGNALS

The following signals can be used to control B<stunnel> in Unix environment:

=over 4

=item SIGHUP

Force a reload of the configuration file.

Some global options will not be reloaded:

=over 4

=item *

chroot

=item *

foreground

=item *

pid

=item *

setgid

=item *

setuid

=back

The use of the 'setuid' option will also prevent B<stunnel> from binding to privileged
(<1024) ports during configuration reloading.

When the 'chroot' option is used, B<stunnel> will look for all its files (including
the configuration file, certificates, the log file and the pid file) within the chroot
jail.

=item SIGUSR1

Close and reopen the B<stunnel> log file.
This function can be used for log rotation.

=item SIGUSR2

Log the list of active connections.

=item SIGTERM, SIGQUIT, SIGINT

Shut B<stunnel> down.

=back

The result of sending any other signals to the server is undefined.


=head1 EXAMPLES

In order to provide TLS encapsulation to your local I<imapd> service, use:

    [imapd]
    accept = 993
    exec = /usr/sbin/imapd
    execArgs = imapd

or in remote mode:

    [imapd]
    accept = 993
    connect = 143

In order to let your local e-mail client connect to a TLS-enabled I<imapd>
service on another server, configure the e-mail client to connect to localhost
on port 119 and use:

    [imap]
    client = yes
    accept = 143
    connect = servername:993

If you want to provide tunneling to your I<pppd> daemon on port 2020,
use something like:

    [vpn]
    accept = 2020
    exec = /usr/sbin/pppd
    execArgs = pppd local
    pty = yes

If you want to use B<stunnel> in I<inetd> mode to launch your imapd
process, you'd use this I<stunnel.conf>.
Note there must be no I<[service_name]> section.

    exec = /usr/sbin/imapd
    execArgs = imapd

To setup SOCKS VPN configure the following client service:

    [socks_client]
    client = yes
    accept = 127.0.0.1:1080
    connect = vpn_server:9080
    verifyPeer = yes
    CAfile = stunnel.pem

The corresponding configuration on the vpn_server host:

    [socks_server]
    protocol = socks
    accept = 9080
    cert = stunnel.pem
    key = stunnel.key

Now test your configuration on the client machine with:

    curl --socks4a localhost http://www.example.com/

An example server mode SNI configuration:

    [virtual]
    ; master service
    accept = 443
    cert =  default.pem
    connect = default.internal.mydomain.com:8080

    [sni1]
    ; slave service 1
    sni = virtual:server1.mydomain.com
    cert = server1.pem
    connect = server1.internal.mydomain.com:8081

    [sni2]
    ; slave service 2
    sni = virtual:server2.mydomain.com
    cert = server2.pem
    connect = server2.internal.mydomain.com:8082
    verifyPeer = yes
    CAfile = server2-allowed-clients.pem

An example of advanced engine configuration allows for authentication with private keys
stored in the Windows certificate store (Windows only).
With the CAPI engine you don't need to manually select the client key to use.
The client key is automatically selected based on the list of CAs trusted by the server.

    engine = capi

    [service]
    engineId = capi
    client = yes
    accept = 127.0.0.1:8080
    connect = example.com:8443

An example of advanced engine configuration to use the certificate and the corresponding private key from a pkcs11 engine:

    engine = pkcs11
    engineCtrl = MODULE_PATH:opensc-pkcs11.so
    engineCtrl = PIN:123456

    [service]
    engineId = pkcs11
    client = yes
    accept = 127.0.0.1:8080
    connect = example.com:843
    cert = pkcs11:token=MyToken;object=MyCert
    key = pkcs11:token=MyToken;object=MyKey

An example of advanced engine configuration to use the certificate and the corresponding private key from a SoftHSM token:

    engine = pkcs11
    engineCtrl = MODULE_PATH:softhsm2.dll
    engineCtrl = PIN:12345

    [service]
    engineId = pkcs11
    client = yes
    accept = 127.0.0.1:8080
    connect = example.com:843
    cert = pkcs11:token=MyToken;object=KeyCert


=head1 NOTES

=head2 RESTRICTIONS

B<stunnel> cannot be used for the FTP daemon because of the nature
of the FTP protocol which utilizes multiple ports for data transfers.
There are available TLS-enabled versions of FTP and telnet daemons, however.


=head2 INETD MODE

The most common use of B<stunnel> is to listen on a network
port and establish communication with either a new port
via the connect option, or a new program via the I<exec> option.
However there is a special case when you wish to have
some other program accept incoming connections and
launch B<stunnel>, for example with I<inetd>, I<xinetd>,
or I<tcpserver>.

For example, if you have the following line in I<inetd.conf>:

    imaps stream tcp nowait root @bindir@/stunnel stunnel @sysconfdir@/stunnel/imaps.conf

In these cases, the I<inetd>-style program is responsible
for binding a network socket (I<imaps> above) and handing
it to B<stunnel> when a connection is received.
Thus you do not want B<stunnel> to have any I<accept> option.
All the I<Service Level Options> should be placed in the
global options section, and no I<[service_name]> section
will be present.  See the I<EXAMPLES> section for example
configurations.

=head2 CERTIFICATES

Each TLS-enabled daemon needs to present a valid X.509 certificate
to the peer. It also needs a private key to decrypt the incoming
data. The easiest way to obtain a certificate and a key is to
generate them with the free B<OpenSSL> package. You can find more
information on certificates generation on pages listed below.

The I<.pem> file should contain the unencrypted private key and
a signed certificate (not certificate request).
So the file should look like this:

    -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    [encoded key]
    -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    [encoded certificate]
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----

=head2 RANDOMNESS

B<stunnel> needs to seed the PRNG (pseudo-random number generator) in
order for TLS to use good randomness.  The following sources are loaded
in order until sufficient random data has been gathered:

=over 4

=item *

The file specified with the I<RNDfile> flag.

=item *

The file specified by the RANDFILE environment variable, if set.

=item *

The file .rnd in your home directory, if RANDFILE not set.

=item *

The file specified with '--with-random' at compile time.

=item *

The contents of the screen if running on Windows.

=item *

The egd socket specified with the I<EGD> flag.

=item *

The egd socket specified with '--with-egd-sock' at compile time.

=item *

The /dev/urandom device.

=back

Note that on Windows machines that do not have console user interaction
(mouse movements, creating windows, etc.) the screen contents are not
variable enough to be sufficient, and you should provide a random file
for use with the I<RNDfile> flag.

Note that the file specified with the I<RNDfile> flag should contain
random data -- that means it should contain different information
each time B<stunnel> is run.  This is handled automatically
unless the I<RNDoverwrite> flag is used.  If you wish to update this file
manually, the I<openssl rand> command in recent versions of B<OpenSSL>,
would be useful.

Important note: If /dev/urandom is available, B<OpenSSL> often seeds the PRNG
with it while checking the random state.  On systems with /dev/urandom
B<OpenSSL> is likely to use it even though it is listed at the very bottom of
the list above.  This is the behaviour of B<OpenSSL> and not B<stunnel>.

=head2 DH PARAMETERS

B<stunnel> 4.40 and later contains hardcoded 2048-bit DH parameters.  Starting
with B<stunnel> 5.18, these hardcoded DH parameters are replaced every 24 hours
with autogenerated temporary DH parameters.  DH parameter generation may take
several minutes.

Alternatively, it is possible to specify static DH parameters in the
certificate file, which disables generating temporary DH parameters:

    openssl dhparam 2048 >> stunnel.pem
