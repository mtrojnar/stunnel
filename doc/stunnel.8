.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBstunnel\fR program is designed to work as \fI\s-1SSL\s0\fR encryption wrapper 
between remote clients and local (\fIinetd\fR\-startable) or remote
servers. The concept is that having non-SSL aware daemons running on
your system you can easily set them up to communicate with clients over
secure \s-1SSL\s0 channels.
.PP
\&\fBstunnel\fR can be used to add \s-1SSL\s0 functionality to commonly used \fIInetd\fR
daemons like \s-1POP\-2, POP\-3,\s0 and \s-1IMAP\s0 servers, to standalone daemons like
\&\s-1NNTP, SMTP\s0 and \s-1HTTP,\s0 and in tunneling \s-1PPP\s0 over network sockets without
changes to the source code.

Note that if you wish to run \fBstunnel\fR in \fIinetd\fR mode (where it
is provided a network socket by a server such as \fIinetd\fR, \fIxinetd\fR,

This is the directory in which \fBstunnel\fR will look for certificates when using
the \fIverify\fR.  Note that the certificates in this directory should be named
\&\s-1XXXXXXXX.0\s0 where \s-1XXXXXXXX\s0 is the hash value of the \s-1DER\s0 encoded subject of the
cert.
.Sp
The hash algorithm has been changed in \fBOpenSSL 1.0.0\fR.  It is required to
c_rehash the directory on upgrade from \fBOpenSSL 0.x.x\fR to \fBOpenSSL 1.x.x\fR.

.IX Item "connect = [HOST:]PORT"
connect to a remote address
.Sp
If no host is specified, the host defaults to localhost.
.Sp
Multiple \fIconnect\fR options are allowed in a single service section.
.Sp
If host resolves to multiple addresses and/or if multiple \fIconnect\fR
options are specified, then the remote address is chosen using a
round-robin algorithm.
.IP "\fBCRLpath\fR = \s-1DIRECTORY\s0" 4
.IX Item "CRLpath = DIRECTORY"
Certificate Revocation Lists directory
.Sp
This is the directory in which \fBstunnel\fR will look for CRLs when

be named \s-1XXXXXXXX\s0.r0 where \s-1XXXXXXXX\s0 is the hash value of the \s-1CRL.\s0
.Sp
The hash algorithm has been changed in \fBOpenSSL 1.0.0\fR.  It is required to

.IP "\fIthread\fR" 4

\&\fBstunnel\fR cannot be used for the \s-1FTP\s0 daemon because of the nature

There are available SSL-enabled versions of \s-1FTP\s0 and telnet daemons, however.
.SS "\s-1INETD MODE\s0"
.IX Subsection "INETD MODE"
The most common use of \fBstunnel\fR is to listen on a network
port and establish communication with either a new port
via the connect option, or a new program via the \fIexec\fR option.
However there is a special case when you wish to have
some other program accept incoming connections and
launch \fBstunnel\fR, for example with \fIinetd\fR, \fIxinetd\fR,
or \fItcpserver\fR.
.PP
For example, if you have the following line in \fIinetd.conf\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    imaps stream tcp nowait root /usr/bin/stunnel stunnel /etc/stunnel/imaps.conf
.Ve
.PP
In these cases, the \fIinetd\fR\-style program is responsible
for binding a network socket (\fIimaps\fR above) and handing
it to \fBstunnel\fR when a connection is received.
Thus you do not want \fBstunnel\fR to have any \fIaccept\fR option.
All the \fIService Level Options\fR should be placed in the
global options section, and no \fI[service_name]\fR section
will be present.  See the \fI\s-1EXAMPLES\s0\fR section for example
configurations.
.SS "\s-1CERTIFICATES\s0"
.IX Subsection "CERTIFICATES"
Each SSL-enabled daemon needs to present a valid X.509 certificate
to the peer. It also needs a private key to decrypt the incoming
data. The easiest way to obtain a certificate and a key is to 
generate them with the free \fBOpenSSL\fR package. You can find more
information on certificates generation on pages listed below.
.PP
The order of contents of the \fI.pem\fR file is important.  It should contain the
unencrypted private key first, then a signed certificate (not certificate
request).  There should be also empty lines after certificate and private key.
Plaintext certificate information appended on the top of generated certificate
should be discarded. So the file should look like this:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&    \-\-\-\-\-BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY\-\-\-\-\-

.SS "\s-1RANDOMNESS\s0"
.IX Subsection "RANDOMNESS"
\&\fBstunnel\fR needs to seed the \s-1PRNG \s0(pseudo random number generator) in
order for \s-1SSL\s0 to use good randomness.  The following sources are loaded
in order until sufficient random data has been gathered:
.IP "\(bu" 4
The file specified with the \fIRNDfile\fR flag.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The file specified by the \s-1RANDFILE\s0 environment variable, if set.

.IP "\(bu" 4
The egd socket specified with '\-\-with\-egd\-sock' at compile time.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The /dev/urandom device.
.PP
With recent (\fBOpenSSL 0.9.5a\fR or later) version of \s-1SSL\s0 it will stop loading
random data automatically when sufficient entropy has been gathered.  With
previous versions it will continue to gather from all the above sources since
no \s-1SSL\s0 function exists to tell when enough data is available.
.PP
Note that on Windows machines that do not have console user interaction
(mouse movements, creating windows, etc.) the screen contents are not
variable enough to be sufficient, and you should provide a random file
for use with the \fIRNDfile\fR flag.
.PP
Note that the file specified with the \fIRNDfile\fR flag should contain
random data \*(-- that means it should contain different information
each time \fBstunnel\fR is run.  This is handled automatically
unless the \fIRNDoverwrite\fR flag is used.  If you wish to update this file
manually, the \fIopenssl rand\fR command in recent versions of \fBOpenSSL\fR,
would be useful.
.PP
Important note: If /dev/urandom is available, \fBOpenSSL\fR often seeds the \s-1PRNG\s0
with it while checking the random state.  On systems with /dev/urandom
\&\fBOpenSSL\fR is likely to use it even though it is listed at the very bottom of
