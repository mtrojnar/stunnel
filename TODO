1. Implement make_sockets implemented with Internet sockets
   instead of Unix sockets for better compatibility.
   (i.e. to avoid random data returned by getpeername(2)).

2. If possible add certificate signed by a thrusted CA.
   If not -> build a web page to add new certificate to browser.

3. Add binary distributions for Solaris and HP-UX.
