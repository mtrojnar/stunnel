stunnel TODO


High priority features.  They will likely be supported some day.
A sponsor could allocate my time to get them faster.
* Perform protocol negotiations after SSL negotiations if possible.
* Command-line server control interface on both Unix and Windows.
* Separate GUI process running as current user on Windows.
* Optional line-buffering of the log file.
* etc/stunnel/conf.d/* files automatically processed while reading
  etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf
* Android GUI.
* Support for CryptoAPI certificates and private keys with OpenSSL CAPI
  engine (this feature is incompatible with FIPS support).
* Indirect CRL support (RFC 3280, section 5).
* Configuration file option to limit the number of concurrent connections.
* SOCKS 4 protocol support.
  http://archive.socks.permeo.com/protocol/socks4.protocol
* Option to redirect instead of rejecting connections on failed authentication.

Low priority features.  They will unlikely ever be supported.
* Provide 64-bit Windows builds (besides 32-bit builds).
  This requires either Microsoft Visual Studio Standard Edition or Microsoft
  Visual Studio Professional Edition in order to retain FIPS compliance.
* Service-level logging configuration (separate verbosity and destination).
* Key renegotiation (re-handshake) for long connections.
* Logging to NT EventLog on Windows.
* Log rotation on Windows.
* Internationalization of logged messages (i18n).
* Generic scripting engine instead or static protocol.c.

Features I won't support, unless convinced otherwise by a wealthy sponsor.
* Protocol support *after* SSL is negotiated:
  - Support for adding X-Forwarded-For to HTTP request headers.
    This feature is less useful since PROXY protocol support is available.
  - Support for adding X-Forwarded-For to SMTP email headers.
    This feature is most likely to be implemented as a separate proxy.
* Additional certificate checks (including wildcard comparison) based on:
  - CN (Common Name);
  - SAN (Subject Alternative Name);
  - O (Organization), and
  - OU (Organizational Unit).
* Set processes title that appear on the ps(1) and top(1) commands.
  I could not find a portable *and* non-copyleft library for it.
