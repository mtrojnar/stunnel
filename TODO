stunnel         Universal SSL tunnel

* High priority features I'm going to support (sponsorship welcomed):
  - Add service-level logging.
  - Log file rotation with a signal on Unix and with GUI on Windows.
  - Graceful configuration reload with a signal on Unix and with GUI on Windows.
  - In transparent proxy mode add an option to connect destination address
    of the the original connection instead of a fixed IP list.

* Low priority features I'm going to support (sponsorship welcomed):
  - Replace protocol.c with a scripting engine.
  - Add some scripting capabilities *after* SSL negotiations.
  - Key renegotiation (re-handshake) for long connections.
  - Internationalization of logged messages (i18n).
  - Logging to NT eventlog.
  - SOCKS 4 protocol support.

  - Modify ./configure to support cross-compilation.
  - Add support for Server Name Indication SSL extension.

* Features I'd prefer NOT to support (waiting for a wealthy sponsor):
  - Authentication based on reverse DNS lookup matching CN of X.509.
  - HTTP protocol support (adding X-Forwarded-For header to each request,
    URL rewriting).
  - SMTP protocol support (adding X-Forwarded-For header to each email).
